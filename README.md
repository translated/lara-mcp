<summary><strong>What is MCP?</strong></summary>

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standardized communication protocol that enables AI applications to connect with external tools, data sources, and services. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications - just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

Lara Translate MCP Server enables AI applications to access Lara Translate's powerful translation capabilities through this standardized protocol.

<summary><strong>How Lara Translate MCP Works</strong></summary>

Lara Translate MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol to provide seamless translation capabilities to AI applications. The integration follows this flow:

1. **Connection Establishment**: When an MCP-compatible AI application starts, it connects to configured MCP servers, including the Lara Translate MCP Server
2. **Tool & Resource Discovery**: The AI application discovers available translation tools and resources provided by the Lara Translate MCP Server
3. **Request Processing**: When translation needs are identified:
   - The AI application formats a structured request with text to translate, language pairs, and optional context
   - The MCP server validates the request and transforms it into Lara Translate API calls
   - The request is securely sent to Lara Translate's API using your credentials
4. **Translation & Response**: Lara Translate processes the translation using advanced AI models
5. **Result Integration**: The translation results are returned to the AI application, which can then incorporate them into its response

This integration architecture allows AI applications to access professional-grade translations without implementing the API directly, while maintaining the security of your API credentials and offering flexibility to adjust translation parameters through natural language instructions.

<summary><strong>Why to use Lara inside an LLM</strong></summary>

Integrating Lara with LLMs creates a powerful synergy that significantly enhances translation quality for non-English languages.

#### Why General LLMs Fall Short in Translation
While large language models possess broad linguistic capabilities, they often lack the specialized expertise and up-to-date terminology required for accurate translations in specific domains and languages.

#### Laraâ€™s Domain-Specific Advantage
Lara overcomes this limitation by leveraging Translation Language Models (T-LMs) trained on billions of professionally translated segments. These models provide domain-specific machine translation that captures cultural nuances and industry terminology that generic LLMs may miss. The result: translations that are contextually accurate and sound natural to native speakers.

#### Designed for Non-English Strength
Lara has a strong focus on non-English languages, addressing the performance gap found in models such as GPT-4. The dominance of English in datasets such as Common Crawl and Wikipedia results in lower quality output in other languages. Lara helps close this gap by providing higher quality understanding, generation, and restructuring in a multilingual context.

#### Faster, Smarter Multilingual Performance
By offloading complex translation tasks to specialized T-LMs, Lara reduces computational overhead and minimizes latencyâ€”a common issue for LLMs handling non-English input. Its architecture processes translations in parallel with the LLM, enabling for real-time, high-quality output without compromising speed or efficiency.

#### Cost-Efficient Translation at Scale
Lara also lowers the cost of using models like GPT-4 in non-English workflows. Since tokenization (and pricing) is optimized for English, using Lara allows translation to take place before hitting the LLM, meaning that only the translated English content is processed. This improves cost efficiency and supports competitive scalability for global enterprises.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Lara Translate API Credentials
    - To get them you can refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.laratranslate.com/docs/getting-started#step-3---configure-your-credentials)
- An LLM client that supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), such as Claude Desktop, Cursors, or GitHub Copilot
- NPX or Docker (depending on your preferred installation method)

### ðŸ”Œ Installation

#### Introduction
The installation process is standardized across all MCP clients. It involves manually adding a configuration object to your client's MCP configuration JSON file.
> If you're unsure how to configure an MCP with your client, please refer to your MCP client's official documentation.

Lara Translate MCP supports multiple installation methods, including NPX and Docker. \
Below, we'll use NPX as an example.

---

#### Installation & Configuration

**Step 1**: Open your client's MCP configuration JSON file with a text editor, then copy and paste the following snippet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lara-translate": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@translated/lara-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LARA_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
        "LARA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2**: Replace `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` and `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>` with your Lara Translate API credentials (refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.laratranslate.com/docs/getting-started#step-3---configure-your-credentials) for details).

**Step 3**: Restart your MCP client.

---

#### Verify Installation

After restarting your MCP client, you should see Lara Translate MCP in the list of available MCPs.
> The method for viewing installed MCPs varies by client. Please consult your MCP client's documentation.

To verify that Lara Translate MCP is working correctly, try translating with a simple prompt:
```text
Translate with Lara "Hello world" to Spanish
```

Your MCP client will begin generating a response. If Lara Translate MCP is properly installed and configured, your client will either request approval for the action or display a notification that Lara Translate is being used.
